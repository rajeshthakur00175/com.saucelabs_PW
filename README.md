# Setup Guide

## Manual Setup (Direct API)

**Requirements**: You must be a repository admin to complete these steps.

1. Install the Claude GitHub app to your repository: https://github.com/apps/claude
2. Add authentication to your repository secrets ([Learn how to use secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)):
   - Either `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for API key authentication
   - Or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` for OAuth token authentication (Pro and Max users can generate this by running `claude setup-token` locally)
3. Copy the workflow file from [`examples/claude.yml`](../examples/claude.yml) into your repository's `.github/workflows/`

> Don't want to store a static API key at all? See [Workload Identity Federation](#workload-identity-federation) below.
